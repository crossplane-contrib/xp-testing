# End-to-end test framework for Crossplane providers

 `xp-testing` is a library enabling end-to-end tests for Crossplane providers, based on 
 [kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework/).

This testing framework helps to set up test suites, by handling the deployments of crossplane and providers & ensures 
providers are loaded into the cluster & helpers to speedup test development.

* [`pkg/xpconditions`](./pkg/xpconditions) supports with assertions
* [`pkg/resources`](./pkg/resources) helps with handling of importing and deleting of resources while testing & an opinionated way to 
  create Test Features
* [`pkg/setup`](./pkg/setup) provides a default cluster setup, ready to take just the most necessary information and boostrap the 
  test suite
* [`pkg/xpenvfuncs`](./pkg/xpenvfuncs) provide basic functions to compose a test environment
